Welcome to pyModis documentation!
===================================

This library was developed to replace old bash scripts by Markus Neteler 
to download MODIS data from NASA FTP server. It is very useful for 
`GIS and Remote Sensing Platform`_ of `Fondazione Edmund Mach`_ to update 
its large dataset of MODIS data.

We acknowledge the Fondazione Edmund Mach for promoting the development of and contribution to free and open source software.
