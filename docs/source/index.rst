Welcome to pyModis's documentation!
===================================

This library was developed to replace old bash scripts of Markus Neteler to download MODIS data from NASA FTP server. It is very useful for `GIS and Remote Sensing Platform`_ of `Fondazione Edmund Mach`_ to update its large dataset of MODIS data.

Thanks to the Fondazione that leave us to develop and contribute to free and open source software.
